# Forest-fire

One of the significant environmental concerns is wildfire. Every year thousands of hectares of land are annihilated over the world, which causes damage to 
the Environment. Detecting the fire in timber-producing land has become the major concern and it is the basic need to reduce the environmental loss. Advancements and 
new techniques can be used to detect and predict the forest fire at the earliest to anticipate and recognize backwoods fires. The pattern is to incorporate 
intelligence techniques to detect fire at an early stage. This paper presents an outline of assorted detection techniques that are used to identify wildfires in 
various regions. The different approaches and frameworks in wildfire detection are recognized and evaluated. The various works and methodological systems that are used 
to detect systems are surveyed along with the factors, the occurrence of fire and risk parameters are analyzed. Yolov5 object detection is used to detect fires in the 
long runs. For prediction, neural network model is used along with the fire parameters. Temperature, Pressure, Humidity and wind speed are most significant parameters 
of fire. The global information provided by the model is taken for the final result for decision making. The detection results are based on the features extracted by 
the Yolov5 model and the prediction results are based on the Neural Network model. In the proposed method the performance is increased by 97% with 3% of error.
